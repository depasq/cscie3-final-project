CSCI E-3 Introduction to Web Programming Using Javascript

Harvard University Extension School

Final Project

My final project uses javascript to read from a JSON-formatted database of the Chandra X-ray Observatory's press releases to serve up a random press release upon page load. The code also uses the WorldWide Telescope API to show location of the object on the sky. Further options include a button that loads a new random release, and a link that expands the search options to include a name based search, filtering search and sorting options. I used list.js to provide the heavy lifting for creating the searchable/sortable list from the JSON data. The list window is scrollable and any press release in the list can be clicked to load it into the main window and see it's contextual location on the sky in the WWT portal.
